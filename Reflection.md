My dataset is sructured because there are no errors in the data.The columns are in their write format and there are no missing values.
One challenge i am facing is the "Ghana cedis symbol" which i added to the amount column.I used excel for my work and the Ghana cedis was showing perfectly but, when i saved it as a CSV file 
the Ghana cedis symbol has changed to a question mark.
A structured data like this could be used to develop personal finance apps,budgeting apps etc.
